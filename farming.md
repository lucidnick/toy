T16, 8 mod. Spec Harby, all of beyond nods and pick the node to block the boss. 
Also all of the 4%+ scarab nodes. Deli is prob better exp but scarab nodes bring you lots of profit.
3x Harby scarab, warhoards x1 and regency x1

Pick up Niko sulphite along the way and turn your azurite into resonators when done.
Look for Starfall Crater and fight the Black Knight for a chance at Svallin.

Skip all ores, only look for the fallen crater for svallin boss and open the big lost shipment box when it spawns, don't open each small box. You get 1 boss crater every 35ish maps and its 5-10% to drop svalinn
