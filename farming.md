T16, 8 mod. Spec Harby, all of beyond nods and pick the node to block the boss. 
Also all of the 4%+ scarab nodes. Deli is prob better exp but scarab nodes bring you lots of profit.

Pick up Niko sulphite along the way and turn your azurite into resonators when done.
Look for Starfall Crater and fight the Black Knight for a chance at Svallin.

Skip all ores, only look for the fallen crater for svallin boss and open the big lost shipment box when it spawns, don't open each small box. You get 1 boss crater every 35ish maps and its 5-10% to drop svalinn

https://poeplanner.com/a/667k ambush beyond
5 scarabs:
Beyond Scarab of the Invasion
Ambush Scarab of Discernment
Ambush Scarab of Hidden Compartments
Ambush Scarab of Potency
Ambush Scarab
Kirac Modifier: ambush

The Swap: Replace Ambush Scarab of Potency with Anarchy Scarab of Gigantification.
Why it works: You will have giant Rogue Exiles everywhere. Each time you kill one, you instantly spawn a massive cluster of Beyond demons.
Atlas Tree: Take the "Rogue Exile" nodes (Vile Resurgence).
Result: This turns your map into a constant explosion of Beyond spawns.

Recommended "Mixed" Setup (The Balanced Version):
Beyond Scarab of the Invasion (Your engine)

Ambush Scarab of Discernment (Your quality)
Ambush Scarab of Hidden Compartments (Your double loot)
Domination Scarab (Adds Shrines/Buffs/Rares)
Anarchy Scarab (Adds Rogue Exiles for massive Beyond triggers)
Kirac: Ambush

Fenumal Plagued Arachnid.
The Cost: Usually 0.5 to 1 Divine

The "Ambush/Beyond" strat works best in Jungle Valley.
